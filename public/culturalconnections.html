              Buses don't come to a bus stop on time or leave earlier.In Japan,
              sometimes buses come late, but does'nt leave before planed time.

              The shower's flowing water power is weak and the shower head is
              fixed. It is inconvenient that the head is fixed because it is
              difficult to wash the body.

          My top personal objective at this stage in your life.
        </h2>
        <p>
          My top personal objective at this stage is finding job in Canada. I
          would like experience to work in English in foreign country because I
          would like to be a person who can work all over the world. I have
          programming skills allow me to work all over the world, but I don't
          have enough English skill to work. If I can do that, I can live all
          over the world.
